## MVC

## Model
A model is data used by a program. This may be a database, file, or a simple object, such as an icon or a character in a video game.

## View
A view is the means of displaying objects within an application. Examples include displaying a window or buttons or text within a window. It includes anything that the user can see.

## Controller
A controller updates both models and views. It accepts input and performs the corresponding update. For example, a controller can update a model by changing the attributes of a character in a video game. It may modify the view by displaying the updated character in the game.

The three parts of MVC are interconnected (see diagram). The view displays the model for the user. The controller accepts user input and updates the model and view accordingly. While MVC is not required in application design, many programming languages and IDEs support the MVC architecture, making it an common choice for developers.
