## MVC

## Model
A model is data used by a program. This may be a database, file, or a simple object, such as an icon or a character in a video game.

## View
A view is the means of displaying objects within an application. 

## Controller
A controller updates both models and views. It accepts input and performs the corresponding update. For example, a controller can update a model by changing the attributes of a character in a video game. It may modify the view by displaying the updated character in the game.
